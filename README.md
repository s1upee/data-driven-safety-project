# **Workplace Safety Data Analysis Project**

## **Overview**
This project analyzes **OSHA workplace safety data (2023)** using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** to identify key trends in **injuries, fatalities, and workplace restrictions** across various industries. The goal is to apply **data-driven insights** to improve workplace safety and regulatory compliance.

## **Objectives**
- Identify **high-risk sectors** with the most workplace injuries.
- Analyze **fatalities by industry** to highlight hazardous work environments.
- Examine the **correlation between job restrictions (DJTR) and injuries**.
- Provide **actionable recommendations** based on the findings.

## **Dataset**
- **Source:** OSHA Workplace Safety Data (2023)
- **Key Columns Used:**
  - `sector` – Industry classification
  - `total_injuries` – Number of workplace injuries
  - `total_deaths` – Fatalities recorded
  - `total_dafw_cases` – Days Away From Work (DAFW) cases
  - `total_djtr_cases` – Days of Job Transfer/Restriction (DJTR) cases

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Data processing and visualization
- **Pandas**: Data cleaning and aggregation
- **Matplotlib**: Graphical representation of safety trends

## **How to Run the Analysis**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/workplace-safety-analysis.git
   cd workplace-safety-analysis
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```
3. **Run the Python script:**
   ```bash
   python workplace_safety_analysis.py
   ```
4. **Review results:**
   - The script will generate **bar charts and scatter plots** showing workplace safety trends.
   - The summary findings will be printed in the console.

## **Project Findings**
- **Manufacturing, Healthcare, and Retail Trade** have the highest workplace injuries.
- **Fatalities are most frequent in Mail & Parcel Delivery, Construction, and Trucking.**
- **Positive correlation** between job restrictions and workplace injuries suggests hazardous work environments.

## **Next Steps**
- Apply **predictive analytics** to forecast future safety risks.
- Implement **stronger workplace safety training** for high-risk industries.
- Use **compliance monitoring** tools to reduce OSHA violations.
